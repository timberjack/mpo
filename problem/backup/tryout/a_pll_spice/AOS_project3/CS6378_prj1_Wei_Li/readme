Getting Started
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In directory '/src', there are the source files to get you started.
Three server codes are nearly the same, except port number defination. The last code is client.
All object files are in the other directory '/Prj1_AOS'.



Running the program
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Copy directory '/Prj1_AOS' to any place under home directory.

2. Open a terminal, ssh to net11, go to '/Prj1_AOS/s1', Enter the following command:
   $ ./server
   
3. Open a terminal, ssh to net11, go to '/Prj1_AOS/s2', Enter the following command:
   $ ./server
   
4. Open a terminal, ssh to net11, go to '/Prj1_AOS/s3', Enter the following command:
   $ ./server 
   
5. Open a terminal, ssh to netxx, go to '/Prj1_AOS/c', Enter the following command:
   $ ./client net1x abcd
   (x here must be 1, 2, or 3. abcd can be 6658, 6660, 6662, which are predefined port numbers.)

6. As long as the connection is established, there will be instructions on how to
   1.Create a file;   2.Read a file;   3.Write to the EOF.
   Just follow the steps.

7. Once a job is done or fail, a corresponding message will be shown on the client's terminal.
   Then the client quit the connection, but servers are still listening.

Have "fun"!
