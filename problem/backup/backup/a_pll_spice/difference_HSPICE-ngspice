0. ngspice is much SLOWER!!!
1. First line must be starting with *
2. transient analysis is ".tran" in ngspice, but ".trans" in HSPICE
3. When instantiating sub-circuit, there is no "/" before subckt's name
4. ngspice has interactive mode by adding:
	.control
	run
	set filetype=ascii
	plot v(x)
	.endc
5.
